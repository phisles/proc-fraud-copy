ATC-NY has a successful history developing innovative knowledge management and knowledge graph solutions for Air Force applications, as reflected in our VSTaR and PMAF projects.\nVSTaR\u2013Virtual Scalable Tactical Repository: Tactical users must have reliable access to information stored in legacy networked data repositories, which were designed years ago with disparate data formats, schemas, and semantics.\nIn order to effectively use this information, the warfighter needs agile information management\u2014that is, that can harmonize data from a wide range of repositories and formats, both legacy and new, and do so while making effective use of dynamically varying tactical link quality and availability.\nATC-NY, in collaboration with Architecture Technology Corporation, developed a prototype Virtual Scalable Tactical Repository (VSTaR), which implements a single virtual repository with a single query language that supports quality of service (QoS) concepts.\nVSTaR is based on two core ideas.\nFirst, it is a general-purpose engine for processing queries from combinations of remote repositories.\nIt orchestrates the retrieval of data and combines the results into a unified answer.\nThe second significant feature of VSTaR is its use of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) as a basic model for data.\nRDF is a mature and standardized technology that naturally represents data as \u201cthings\u201d and their attributes as name- value pairs; other representations, such as relational databases or XML, can be translated into this basic model and combined.\n(Completed: 7/20/2010.\nContact: Robert Flo, AFRL/RIS, 315-330-2334.) 4.2 Related Work by Others Web knowledge graphs, both free and commercial, have been created and maintained for many years.\nA few openly available knowledge graphs, such as DBpedia, YAGO, and Freebase, were largely constructed from semi-structured knowledge, such as Wikipedia, or harvested from the web with a combination of statistical and linguistic methods.\nLarge-scale knowledge graphs attempt to balance completeness and correctness.\nVarious refinement methods have been reported to infer and add missing knowledge to such graphs, as well as detect errors, which have shown to be effective for focused areas of knowledge but require significant improvement to become widely applicable.\n[1] The Air Force previously funded research and development of the Advanced Text Exploitation Assistant (ATEA), which provides an interactive KG exploration and editing tool.\nATEA was demonstrated to reduce manual effort required for Air Force analysts to perform representative tasks involving KGs, such as identifying the entities in a social network from a collection of 1,250 documents and answering 15 requests for information (RFIs) using a collection of 88 documents.\nWhile ATEA saves user changes to KGs in its database and shares updates across users, the underlying insights and reasoning behind those user modifications are not captured for future KG updates.\n[2] Many research efforts have proposed and experimented with KG visualization and exploration methodologies.\nOne such effort reported the KGBrowser, which introduced an ontology that enables the expression and publication of visual configurations, so users can reuse and share their graph visualization components across tools and environments.\n[3] Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the first page of this volume.\n18",
