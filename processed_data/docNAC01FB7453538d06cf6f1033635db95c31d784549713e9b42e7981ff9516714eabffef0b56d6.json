        "5": "Data has emerged as a pivotal component of modern warfare, rivaling conventional weapons in its strategic significance.\nThe seamless flow of information is integral to the operational effectiveness of our economy, military capabilities, and command structures.\nAs we navigate increasingly complex global military dynamics, information superiority\u2014the capacity to collect, process, and exploit operational data\u2014becomes crucial for outpacing adversaries.\nThe demand for a real-time strategic knowledge architecture capable of aggregating operational data is growing, evident in the use cases of the Department of the Air Force (DAF) Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR).\nThis architecture would facilitate rapid decision-making across various scenarios, including combat, humanitarian operations, and peacetime engagements.\nBy converting data into actionable intelligence, we can enhance situational awareness, empower decision-makers, and optimize power projection through Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) across cyberspace and physical domains.\nThis transformation informs faster tactical responses and sustains operational readiness in an evolving battlefield landscape.\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) have become essential tools across industries; in commercial settings, KGs often function as a unified, authoritative source of truth, even if deployed across distributed infrastructures.\nHowever, military applications demand a different approach.\nOperational units, such as individual squadrons or organizations, must be able to construct, adapt, and customize their KGs to address unique engagement scenarios.\nThis is particularly exacerbated if a unit needs to operate in a contested environment under degraded network conditions, such that even a unit\u2019s KG may diverge from itself.\nThis decentralized need inevitably leads to the creation of multiple disconnected or partially aligned KGs, increasing the risk of information silos and fragmented knowledge.\nCreating a robust solution for interactive and editable KGs that can effectively manage the complexities of dynamic, real-time decision-making scenarios while ensuring interoperability across organizational units involves various engineering challenges.\nOur team possesses the expertise necessary to tackle these obstacles head-on.\nFurthermore, Technergetics has established a solid reputation in this domain, leveraging extensive experience in large-scale data collection and KG development to enhance the effectiveness of our solution.\nIn this Phase 1 effort, our combined team will assess the feasibility of a software ecosystem that brings these solutions together, along with a deep alternative analysis of current SOTA methodologies in dynamic KG alignment and reinforcement learning (RL), to advance the development of KnowFlow: An Interactive, Mutable, and Federated KG Environment (IMF- KGE), a novel solution for intelligence analysis, enhanced situational awareness, threat detection, and targeting operations.\nAnticipated Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development: We propose to research and develop KnowFlow IMF-KGE to address the DAF need for adaptive, interactive, and dynamic KGs.\nOur effort focuses on applying version control principles to manage dynamic mutations within the IMF-KGE.\nWith these principles in place, we can automate data ingestion, mapping, and recommendation features while providing users with a streamlined user interface (UI) to interact with the IMF-KGE.\nThe result should be increased ML labeling efficiency, streamlined",
