Narrative Dr.\nTodd Carrico, former Program Manager of the DARPA Advanced Logistics Program (ALP) and UltraLog program, founded Cougaar Software, Inc.\n(CSI) in 2001 with the specific intent to complete, extend, and commercialize the Cognitive Agent Architecture (COUGAAR) Open Source technology that came from these programs.\nThe company\u2019s vision was to take COUGAAR Open Source from a TRL 5 distributed architecture framework to a TRL 9 intelligent systems development platform.\nOver the past twenty years (20), the CSI team has developed and delivered our vision with ActiveEdge\u00ae, our commercial agent-based platform for distributed and intelligent decision support systems.\nIn that time, the ActiveEdge\u00ae platform has evolved from a robust autonomy architecture for everything from autonomy in motion (robotics) to autonomy at rest (decision support applications) and everything in between.\nThe platform has proven to support the entire solutions development life cycle, thus empowering developers to develop and deploy intelligent applications and enhance legacy applications with a thin layer of intelligence.\nActiveEdge\u00ae is based on Marvin Minsky\u2019s \u201cTheory of Mind,\u201d attempting to emulate human cognition in software.\nUsing this approach, agents can form human-collaborative decision support, planning, execution management, and analytics systems capable of managing data and complexity beyond those of most conventional architectures.\nThe agent model emulates behaviors to observe, reason, plan, and act, allowing customers to automate portions of critical decision-making processes.\nDesigned to transform data from complex processes into usable knowledge, ActiveEdge\u00ae provides a distinct competitive advantage to the battlefield and military domain applications.\nActiveEdge\u00ae integrates many advanced concepts of distributed computing, semantic reasoning, knowledge graphs, agent-based reasoning, planning, tasking, and more.\nThe ActiveEdge\u00ae platform is an evolving framework to manifest those concepts in a complete development and integration platform for human-collaborative systems.\nIn determining SBIRs/STTRs to pursue, CSI has been very selective to ensure the opportunities proposed are a good fit for the use, hardening, and enhancement of the ActiveEdge\u00ae platform and associated capabilities, thus supporting all aspects of Artificial Intelligence, Autonomy, and Decision Support.\nIn summary, CSI has awards for the following SBIRs: Active Methods STTR (ST02-03): Phase I was completed in 2003, and Phase II was completed in December 2006.\nBased on the Phase II development, CSI heavily utilized the Active Methods technology in the first release of our commercial product ActiveEdge\u00ae during 2005-2006.\nThis technology was further developed through our own investment and other commercial and Government efforts and became the ActiveDesktop framework within ActiveEdge\u00ae.\nActiveDesktop provides an agent-based desktop environment and the core visualization and application management services for that environment and supports the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm and allows coordination, data sharing, and collaboration among local and remote desktop applications.\nMore recently, CSI has been moving to Angular web interfaces and micro-services but has kept many of the ActiveDesktop concepts in human-collaborative interface design and use.\nCommander\u2019s Portal Technologies (A03-086): Phase I was completed in 2004, and Phase II was completed in September 2006.\nThe Commander\u2019s Portal technology was also incorporated into ActiveEdge\u00ae and was used as part of the technology infrastructure in the Simulation & C2 Information Systems Connectivity Experiments (SINCE) for the US Army.\nThe Commander\u2019s Portal technology was then transitioned to an SBIR Phase III contract under the US Army Logistics Innovation Agency (LIA) to utilize as a key component of LIA\u2019s Enterprise Based Adaptive Logistics (EBAL) project.\nThis project was completed in 2010.\nThe key component of the EBAL Phase II and Phase III was using the Commander\u2019s Portal technology as the building block for the LogC2 \u201cPortal\u201d of this effort.\nWe also used the Commander\u2019s Portal Technology under a contract for Joint Forces J4 to demonstrate a Logistics Decision Support Tool through a Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) scenario.\nBased on operational level logistician's procedures, this project demonstrated a decision support capability that supports the rapid collaborative definition of Courses of Action and logistical feasibility assessment based on calculated critical resource requirements and materiel demand.\nDistributed Frameworks for Dynamic Human/Agent Collaborative Problem Solving (DARPA06-008): Phase I started in 2007 and was completed in September 2010.\nThe key objectives of this SBIR focused on the following three design pillars: 1.\nA comprehensive framework for implementing distributed problem-solving networks specifically geared toward maximizing the effectiveness of human/agent collaboration; 2.\nA suite of services and support infrastructure to enable the collaboration, cooperation, and communication between human and agent actors Privileged and confidential and not subject to disclosure pursuant to 15 U.S.C.\n638 (k)(4) and 5 U.S.C.\n552.\nLast Updated On: 08/28/2023 Page 3/5",

CALBT (AF182-048): Phase 1 was completed in November 2019, and Phase II was completed in May 2022.\nThe focus of this SBIR was to explore the use of AI to support efficient automation and pallet optimization in order to maximize the value of the scarce aircraft space while ensuring that all pallets are compliant, compatible, and meet transportation and handling regulations.\nCALBT was envisioned to be an automated web and mobile application that will increase the efficiency of pallet planning and optimization of the pallet load, thus optimizing the use of space in the aircraft into which the pallets will be loaded.\nCSI used several technologies to develop the application, including Wildfly, Keycloak, Angular, Babylon, Cordova, Andriod SDK, and ML Kit.\nThese different technologies were chosen to ensure that the application is lightweight, powerful, secure, and scalable so it can support the AI analytics and 3D visualizations necessary.\nBased on the completion of the final demonstration at Dover Aerial Port, CSI successfully designed, developed, and tested an automated pallet planning solution.\nElements of this solution are under consideration for the Air Force Aerial Port of the Future effort.\nCSI anticipates an SBIR Phase III IDIQ will be awarded in the fall of 2023, to continue the development of the Configured Airlift Load Builder to be renamed Congruency Engine for Rapid Baseline & Effective Readiness of Unified Services (CERBERUS).\nCERBERUS will be an automated system with algorithms that take a diverse set of air cargo, conveyances, and operator preferences to produce optimal staging plans and load configurations.\nIt is anticipated that this effort will be field-tested as part of the Air-Forces JCDT, Aerial Port of the Future (APoF), which is due to be completed in 2025.\nMobile Configured Airlift Load Calculator - MCALC (N201-021): Phase I was completed in November 2020.\nThe focus of this SBIR was to develop an automated lightweight and scalable load-building application for aircraft that can measure and input unique cargo dimensions and locations within the aircraft, support staging development for more efficient cargo loading, generate optimal cargo configurations with restraints using a handheld device, and display multiple unique aircraft loading spaces and aircraft tiedown locations.\nPhase I identified data inputs and coordination requirements, researched optimization algorithms, evaluated scanning and rendering technologies, developed a design for a mobile application that supports cargo planning, and assessed the feasibility of the design.\nAI for DLA Distribution Center Warehouses (DLA221-004): Phase I was completed in April 2022.\nThe focus of this Phase I SBIR was on AI-based prototype(s) that can exploit data from various sources, identify and learn patterns in that data, and use those patterns to perform specific prediction, identification, and accountability functions.\nCSI\u2019s effort during Phase I focused on the feasibility of integrating technology and lessons learned from previous CSI DoD logistics research and development efforts and exploring the possibility of improving DLA warehousing and distribution operations through the integration of AI/ML, automation, and IOT.\nThe heart of the envisioned prototype was to draw meaningful conclusions from disparate data sets resident in unconnected data systems within the DLA item order and fulfillment systems in the hope that this conclusion would provide better accountability, manpower planning, and high priority item identification.\nThere were no Phase II awards made for this SBIR.\nDefining and Leveraging digital Twins in Autonomous undersea operations DELTA (D211-24): Phase I was completed in October 2022.\nThe focus of Phase I was to assess and analyze the feasibility of extending digital twins to the undersea operational environment for autonomous vehicle applications, determine the effects of undersea intermittent communications on the implementation of digital twins in this domain, and define \u201cdigital twin\u201d use cases in an undersea operational setting.\nCSI was looking to address whether the implementation of digital twins can add value to the Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) mission space, ranging in scale from single UUV deployments to hundreds of missions, and if so, how digital twins should be employed in various scenarios.\nCSI is seeking to advance human-collaborative problem solving with technologies that utilize distributed agents as the framework, hybrid knowledge graphs as the knowledge representation, and utilize a range of AI/ML, mathematics, Operations Research, and other techniques as the behaviors.\nUsing a divide-and-conquer strategy, large, complex problems can be broken into smaller problems, solved, and recombined where each small problem is solved using the most effective technique(s).\nCSI has been developing and using this strategy for 20+ years and can now solve very large, very complex problems in highly automated, human-collaborative ways.\nApplying this approach to logistics, operations, autonomy/robotics, and data analytics have proven highly effective and powerful.\nCSI looks forward to continuing to develop state- of-the-art solutions and, where appropriate, utilize SBIR/STTR projects to facilitate solving challenging DOD problems.\nCommercialized Awards Listed below are the sales revenue and investment details resulting from the technology developed under these SBIR/STTR awards.\nDistributed Frameworks for Dynamic Human/Agent Collaborative Problem Solving Privileged and confidential and not subject to disclosure pursuant to 15 U.S.C.\n638 (k)(4) and 5 U.S.C.\n552.\nLast Updated On: 08/28/2023 1 of 2 Page 4/5",
