        "5": "This specific implementation is required to meet the requirements set forth in the topic, namely: updating the graph's underlying ontology, inferring additional edges between nodes, highlighting conflicting information and information gaps, and suggesting additional changes to the graph.\nThe nodal function generation architecture allows users to interact with the dynamic knowledge graph at a granular level and trigger expected responses from the graph that would traditional fail in a graph built on top of a semantic implementation.\nAnticipated Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development: If the project is successful there will be a resulting paradigm shift not just in how users can interact with dynamic knowledge graphs, but in the intelligence process as a whole.\nThe nodal function generation architecture removes the burden of needing to know exact data types, data structures, and expected values.\nBeyond that, the automatic correlation and pattern recognition between disparate datasets, more sophisticated than the current standard of semantic matching, will enable analysts to uncover hidden patterns critical to modern conflicts.\nAutomatically identifying conflicting information and pointing out information gaps is a critical capability due to the evolving nature of 5th generation warfare and the downstream information and psywar.\nIn terms of commercial application Perseides is already in the process of offering a commercial solution integrated with the Nomadik civil intelligence platform being developed for cities and states to better coordinate their city services and associated data - starting with the homeless crisis.\nCities currently face a myriad of crises that require coordinated data and resources to properly address but cities currently lack a solution to achieve the level of coordination required.\nThe Nomadik civil intelligence platform functions as a common operating picture for cities to put every stakeholder on the same page to allow them to more efficiently and effectively carry out their responsibilities.\nThe nodal architecture allows cities to uncover hidden patterns and correlations that allow them to utilize their limited resources to produce outsized impacts.\nWhile the initial focus of our commercial application is homelessness Perseides Corp has plans to expand into the entire civil intelligence realm: human trafficking, drug trafficking, gang activity, public safety, etc.\nOutside of civil intelligence this architecture has applications across every industry that uses knowledge graphs, or will use knowledge graphs, to achieve their goals.\nFrom finance, to real estate, to insurance, to retail and more.\nThe research and development enabled by this SBIR allows Perseides Corp to dedicate time to developing a noval capability with the potential to transform how industries and organizations understand their data.\nAttention: Disclaimer: For any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, this data except proposal cover sheets shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used or disclosed in whole or in part, provided that if a contract is awarded to this proposer as a result of or in connection with the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the funding agreement.\nThis restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in the data if it is",
