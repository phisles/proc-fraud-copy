        "5": "intuitive human visualization and concept-mapping, and they often have formal semantics that supports machine reasoning, so SkyLine will leverage knowledge graphs to (1) help humans express objectives, tasks, and queries to their machine teammates, and (2) help machines express results, conflicts, assumptions, and other tradecraft considerations to their human operators.\nThis incurs some key research challenges, which SIFT proposes to address by leveraging recent R&D advances in AI/ML and human factors.\nOne challenge is integrating data from authoritative, high confidence sources alongside emerging data from unfamiliar sources, without losing track of confidence and data integrity.\nTo this end, SIFT proposes to use our TRL- 7 provenance-based approach that tracks and visualizes the object-based production, sourcing, reliability, conflict, and corroboration of mission data.\nAnother challenge is managing machine collaborators' contributions to the knowledge graph and ensuring that human operators are not overloaded, misled, or distracted by machine inferences.\nSkyLine will prioritize machine contributions by mission relevance (using spreading activation over the knowledge graph), inferential confidence, and source reliability, and will allow sorting by other desiderata, to help surface the most relevant, highest-utility machine contributions.\nSIFT brings technologies for multimodal visualization and provenance analysis that has been used in U.S.\nIC and DoD mission environments to mitigate risk and address these challenges early in Phase I.\nSIFT is well-positioned with transition customers in the DoD and IC to build SkyLine and deliver it to analysts who need it.\nAnticipated Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development: SkyLine will most directly benefit analysts who access information from diverse sources and integrate data into a central knowledge graph or other mission representation.\nThis task of mission-based information integration is often conducted under time pressures and under requirements for analytic standards (IC Directive 203) and sourcing (IC Directive 206), and while analysts may have access to intelligent software tools, these tools may be burdensome to run and understand.\nSkyLine will facilitate this work by letting analysts use the knowledge graph to express objectives and tasks for machine teammates to complete, and then providing the machines an API for tracking their provenance (i.e., operations, inputs, and outputs) to ensure that SkyLine tracks the lineage of machine contributions.\nSkyLine's provenance will jointly (1) improve analysts' sensemaking about machine contributions to the knowledge graph, and (2) facilitate the analysts' compliance with IC Directives, since the provenance connects each knowledge graph node and link back to the foundational sources.\nIn addition to helping military analysts, SkyLine has commercially-viable capabilities of reducing the time and complexity of collecting information, characterizing patterns, and accruing evidence and counter-evidence in a mission-oriented setting.\nSkyLine has the potential to identify novel human-machine interaction patterns for all-source or OSINT analysis, in addition to providing novel graph schemas for human-machine workflows.\nAttention: Disclaimer: For any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, this data except proposal cover sheets shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used or disclosed in whole or in part, provided that if a contract is awarded to this proposer as a result of or in connection with the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the funding agreement.\nThis restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in the data if it is obtained from another source without restriction.\nThis restriction does not apply to routine handling of proposals for administrative purposes by Government support contractors.\nThe data subject to this restriction is contained on the pages of the proposal listed on the line below.",

collaboration and analysts\u2019 situation awareness, which would comprise dependent variables for human sub- ject research in future phases.\nIn addition to the various annotations shown in Figure 2, we envision dynamic \u201csliders\u201d for modulation: 1.\nThe horizontal Time Slider in Figure 2 will be a point or window of enabled time, fading out the content that has no evidence within the speci\ufb01ed temporal window.\nFor instance, if the allegiance of the Brigade in Figure 2 was once \u201cDonovia\u201d and then it changed subsequently to \u201cWonsi Militia\u201d at a later time, this may not be a true data con\ufb02ict, since they are temporally disjoint.\nThe temporal slider will help bring these insights to light.\n2.\nThe vertical Context Detail Slider in Figure 2 will
