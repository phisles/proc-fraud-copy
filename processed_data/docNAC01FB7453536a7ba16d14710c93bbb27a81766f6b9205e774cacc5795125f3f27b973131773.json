        "9": "Proposal Number [F244-0001-0064] Topic Number [AF244-0001] We are now witnessing a shift as organizations attempt to leverage AI/ML techniques to accelerate the ingestion of data into knowledge graphs.\nWhile this approach holds the potential to dramatically improve processing speed and efficiency, it has also introduced a new set of challenges.\nMany existing workflows are not designed to construct a logical data model or ontology directly from raw data inputs, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications.\nThe rigidity of most knowledge graph architectures compounds this issue, as they often lack the flexibility to dynamically iterate, update connections, or adapt to evolving datasets.\nAdditionally, these systems struggle to integrate or reconcile diverse canonical controlled vocabularies (CCVs), which are critical for maintaining semantic consistency across various domains.\nFurthermore, analysts and users often struggle to fully trust AI/ML automation to consistently make accurate and timely data connections.\nThere is a critical need for systems that can dynamically iterate ontologies, connections, and data models based on the inherent knowledge of subject matter experts (SMEs).\nWe see a fundamental and significant gap in current technologies: The capability to easily edit, update, and modify these systems, while allowing them to learn from SME inputs and continuously refine their models.\nAt Aktiver, we are attempting to solve this problem by developing a system capable of managing large volumes of data while maintaining human-level reasoning at its core.\nInstead of focusing solely on the data or the AI, our approach begins by constructing a logical data model fully aligned with mission requirements and use cases.\nThis ensures that every aspect of data collection, curation, and analysis is directly tied to operational goals.\nOnce the data model is established, Aktiver\u2019s tooling seamlessly integrates the data into an RDF knowledge graph.\nThis knowledge graph can be a third-party system or through the RDF Graph Store inherent in the Aktiver platform.\nBy mapping relationships within the RDF knowledge graph, we are able to unlock the full potential of AI, creating a flexible, evolving representation of the data environment.\nThis approach, combined with Aktiver\u2019s system design, delivers a decision support system with human-level reasoning that far exceeds traditional AI capabilities.\nAktiver provides an enhanced return on AI investments while ensuring the outputs are trusted, relevant, and actionable.\nThe Aktiver platform is designed to scale and adapt as new data is ingested and user modifications are made, enabling the system to handle complex, multi-source data without sacrificing accuracy or efficiency.\nAktiver\u2019s system allows users to interact with the knowledge graph in real time, making corrections and additions, while AI/ML models analyze these inputs and provide suggestions for further updates.\nThese suggestions include inferring new relationships, highlighting conflicting information and identifying data gaps, reducing the manual and cognitive workload for analysts and users.\nIn addition to real-time interactivity, Aktiver integrates human-level reasoning into the AI/ML processes, enabling the system to uncover complex patterns and insights that traditional AI models often miss.\nThis ensures that the knowledge graph remains relevant and trusted by users, leading to faster and more accurate decision-making in strategic, tactical, and direct operations.\nBy combining the strengths of AI/ML, Resource Description Framework-Star (RDF*) flexibility, and human reasoning, Aktiver aims to deliver a system that adapts to evolving operational needs, enhances the speed and quality of analysis, and ensures that analysts and users have the tools to out pace our adversaries in the AI/ML Arms race.\n2.1 Identification and Significance of the Opportunity 2.1.1 Problem Many communities and organizations contain valuable insights and knowledge that remain confined within them, limiting their broader impact.\nThis isolated knowledge could drive innovation, improve problem-solving, and enhance operations across wider networks if made shareable and accessible.\nHowever, existing knowledge-sharing methods often rely heavily on domain experts and narrowly focus on specific data formats, making them costly and complex to maintain.\nFor complex, data-intensive 2",
        "10": "Proposal Number [F244-0001-0064] Topic Number [AF244-0001] environments such as intelligence, defense, healthcare, and finance, the demand for real-time, flexible knowledge graphs that adapt to evolving data inputs and user needs remains unmet.\n2.1.2 Technical Challenge Current knowledge graph systems often lack the flexibility, scalability, and user interactivity needed to handle constantly evolving data inputs and operational demands.\nThis rigidity limits their utility in environments where data insights must be accessible, actionable, and adaptive to deliver meaningful, timely results.\nMany traditional systems struggle to incorporate real-time data updates or respond to user- driven modifications in a way that guarantees accuracy, traceability, and ease of use.\nExisting systems also heavily depend on AI models that, while precise, don\u2019t adapt well to dynamic or uncertain environments, placing a heavy cognitive load on analysts who are forced to work around system limitations rather than using it as a proactive, decision-making tool.\n2.1.3 Solution Aktiver\u2019s approach introduces a data-driven, dynamic ontology model - a structured, adaptable knowledge system that can evolve in real time as new data emerges.\nBy creating a shareable \u201cknowledge map\u201d that adapts over time, the model supports critical decision-making in fast-paced, data-rich environments without relying solely on domain experts.\nThis model is designed to handle data complexity and adapt to operational shifts, providing a more interactive and user-friendly experience.\n2.1.4 How It Works The model operates through two main components: 1.\nBase Ontology Creation - In this phase, the system builds an initial structured knowledge model from community or organizational data, grouping key concepts (like \u201cThreat\u201d or \u201cResource\u201d) into classes.\nIt then identifies relationships and attributes between these concepts, along with any rules or constraints.\nThis foundational ontology ensures data is well-organized and ready to support real-time decision-making.\n2.\nDynamic Ontology Propagation - As the community or organization updates its data, the ontology automatically adjusts.\nThis is achieved through delta scripting, which captures and propagates only the necessary changes rather than transmitting the entire data file, conserving resources.\nFor example, if attributes or relationships within a \u201cProduct\u201d class change, only these updates are transmitted, not the entire ontology.\n2.1.5 Key Business Benefits 1.\nEnhanced Knowledge Sharing and Access - By unlocking valuable knowledge from within complex data, the model makes it accessible to broader teams or external partners, promoting standardized practices and improved decision-making, especially in intelligence, defense, healthcare, and finance.\n2.\nReduced Dependency on Experts - Using a data-driven approach instead of relying on domain experts to curate knowledge manually, the model saves time and reduces costs, enabling organizations to scale knowledge-sharing efforts across various fields.\n3.\nOperational Efficiency - The delta script method propagates only updates, saving both time and bandwidth\u2014a critical feature in distributed and high-stakes environments where rapid access to current data is essential for timely decisions.\n4.\nAdaptability and Real-Time Knowledge Updates - The model\u2019s propagation method ensures that the knowledge remains current and responsive, which is vital in sectors with rapidly evolving information, such as healthcare and defense, where outdated knowledge can have significant implications.\n3",
