The learning model is entirely unsupervised.\nNo training data is required.\n2.) The model that is learned is contextually aware and able to distinguish between events that are simply new and previously unseen vs.\ntruely novel.\nThis approach has proven very e\ufb00ective in pattern of life analysis for cybersecurity to measure in real-time the suspicious behaviors that call for swift action to stop a cyber threat.\n6: Threat Detection Interactive real-time graphs which can connect individual log events and measure the novelty of the events they observe are emerging as a critical capability for threat detection and cybersecurity.\nConnecting events gives a human analyst the context they need to understand the events.\nBut connecting data fast enough to keep up with non-trivial data volumes has Page 15 of 23",
