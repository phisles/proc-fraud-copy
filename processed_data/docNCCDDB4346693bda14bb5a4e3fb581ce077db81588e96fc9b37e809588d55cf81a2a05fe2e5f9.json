Many knowledge graph systems, including neo4j, will execute a Cypher query.\nIn the future, the same technique can be used to produce SPARQL or other query specifications as well, but that is not within the proposed scope here.\nThis approach is promising because it is central to RAG-based chat systems, and is therefore mature and well-understood, and improving rapidly.\nRAG is \u201cretrieval augmented generation\u201d where real-time or proprietary data is added to an LLM chat request to \u201caugment\u201d the chat request with specific context.\nOften, the proprietary data must come from a database, so LLMs are used to create database queries that retrieve required information.\nNeo4j provides \u201ccypherchain.run()\u201d as a function that turns text prompts into Cypher queries.\nEvaluation of query approaches For all three approaches \u2013 the two vector-based query approaches using node2vec and LLM embeddings and the LLM-based Cypher query generation \u2013 we will compute the F1 score by comparing the returned candidate nodes where the system is saying an edit may need to take place with our test data that lists the actual locations where that Edit Class should be applied.\nWe will compute accuracy, precision and F1 scores for each approach, which will help us understand the relative merits of all three approaches.\n4.\nRelated Work None.\n5.\nRelationship with Future Research or Research and Development Datalite proposes this research as it is innovative and designed to produce immediate benefits and also be a foundation for future investigations.\nThe overall likely data flow that combines Classification, Information Retrieval, Query Generation, and Edit Generation is based on our team\u2019s expertise in information retrieval, databases, knowledge graphs, general AI, and LLMs.\nThis overall data flow then suggests particular research activities that are achievable within the SBIR Phase I budget and period of performance limitations.\n8",
