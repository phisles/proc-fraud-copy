Signi\ufb01cance of the Problem or Opportunity In modern Air Force analyst work\ufb02ows, accurate Knowledge Graphs (KGs) play a key role in intelligence product development.\nFor example, in target development, analysts rely on large knowledge graphs to analyze enemy disposition of forces, critical capabilities, and other factors that feed into targeting and strike decision-making.\nAs the situation on the ground is ever-changing, these graphs must be meticulously maintained by the war\ufb01ghters to provide up-to-date situational awareness regarding both friendly and enemy status.\nThis process is already time-consuming, but exacerbating the problem is the complexity of modern knowledge graphs underpinning these systems.\nA modern Knowledge Graph (KG) can have many millions of nodes and edges [1, 2].\nEach of these is an instantiation of a vast collection of fundamental data types de\ufb01ned by the schema.\nThrough the course of analyst work\ufb02ows, they may update nodes and edges in the graph, but also the schema itself.\nTools are needed to ensure that, as these updates take place the war\ufb01ghter is equipped to rapidly introduce downstream changes related to the initial update.\nHowever, we cannot expect a user to manually sort through every possible node in order to check that there are no implied secondary or tertiary updates to the graph.\nAutomation is needed to isolate graph components of relevance to the user\u2019s objectives and then present the user with a prioritized list of updates to adjudicate, thereby maximizing the value of precious analyst time on task.\nKitware is proud to propose WEAVER, a system for rapidly curating updates to knowledge graphs based on user interactions.\nFigure 1 shows our concept of operations.\nWe will use Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence (AI) to automatically compare user activity on speci\ufb01c nodes of the graph to other areas of the data structure.\nWEAVER will automatically identify other candidate nodes and edges that may also need updating and suggest appropriate updates.\nThese updates include updating the graph\u2019s underlying ontology/schema, inferring additional edges between nodes, highlighting con\ufb02icting information in the graph, highlighting information gaps, and suggesting additional changes to the graph because of the user\u2019s modi\ufb01cations.\nIn order to reason about the massive number of edges and nodes, we decompose the problem into two parts.\nThe \ufb01rst is a CNN-based sub-graph ranking module which implements coarse-grained search of potential regions that may require updating or may inform future user edits.\nThis module encodes features on relatively small subgraphs in a way that we can later use this encoding to rapidly align user activity in one area of the graph with elements elsewhere in the structure.\nOnce this coarse-grained alignment is achieved, our LLM system will make \ufb01ne-grained suggestions to updates on nodes and edges within both the graph and schema.\nA limiting factor in modern LLMs is their general lack of introspective ability, they don\u2019t know what they do and do not do well.\nAdditionally, LLMs have limited context windows with which they can operate.\nWe cannot rely on the LLM to accurately self-moderate its con\ufb01dences in this task.\nGiven these limitations, the key to our approach is an Interactive Prompt Re\ufb01nement (IPR) module, which will accomplish two things.\nFirst, it will study user adjudication decisions in order to learn, in real time, which areas of re\ufb01nement the LLM is getting correct and which should not be trusted.\nThis will enable us to calibrate LLM suggestion con\ufb01dence and ensure that valuable analyst cycles are spent looking at the high-probability graph updates \ufb01rst.\nSecond, it will produce re\ufb01nements to the LLM prompts in order to better align the LLM performance with the user\u2019s goals and values.\nKitware is uniquely positioned to achieve the objectives laid out in this proposal.\nWe\u2019ve tackled some of industry\u2019s toughest AI problems, including those dealing with generating, manipulating, and searching graphical data using deep learning methods.\nWe build off an extensive portfolio of LLM research [3\u20135] and knowledge graphs [6].\nRecently, we have gained particular experience in automated knowledge graph generation and management for DoD/IC use cases.\nWe have active work in this area with customers in the Air Force (AFRL Wingman - Section 4.1), Army (SBIR Tech Marketplace - Section 4.2), and NIH (KG Gener- ation for Metabolomics - - Section 4.4).\nThe Kitware AI team has a heritage in developing and transitioning systems for analysts and

connect several edges to nodes \"Information Technology\" and \"United States of America\".\nWith a simple prompt to an LLM, we elicit the recommendations to add connectivity between the pre-existing \"OpenAI\" node and the node \"United States of America\".\nThe LLM inferred that the user was interested in tracking country of incorporation, based on the recent interaction adding this relationship to the \"Net\ufb02ix\" node, and appropriately recommended that this relationship also be created from the \"OpenAI\" node.\nWe also see that the LLM suggested that we create a relationship between \"OpenAI\" and \"arti\ufb01cial intelligence\", the latter of which is a novel node in the graph.\nThis demonstrates an example of the LLM inferring that the user cares about product offerings, and suggesting new information that is baked into the internal world model of the LLM itself, rather than existing in an authoritative source.\nBoth these recommendations, in the WEAVER system, will be passed to a user for adjudication.\nWe can learn via study of user feedback which of these types of updates to trust more in the future.\nAdditionally, we can modify future prompts to bias for or against each kind of suggestion.\nThe following sections detail our plan for achieving this behavior.\n3.1.2 Sub-graph Representation When a user makes updates to a particular node or edge of a graph (or schema), we want to search the rest of the graph for similar nodes that might also need updating.\nDue to the very large nature of production graphs, using any machine learning method directly on the graph to perform node relevance classi\ufb01cation / regression is computationally intractable.\nClassic deep learning methods, such graph CNNs and GNNs, will be incapable of \ufb01tting the entire graph into its receptive \ufb01eld.\nLLM methods are bound by token limits, which will be far exceeded by the amount of information in a graph.\nInstead, we propose to decompose the problem of update recommendations into two main parts.\nFirst, we compute multi-level features of the full graph.\nFigure 4 shows the proposed work\ufb02ow.\nWe extract node-level features by encoding \ufb01eld-value information with a classical text embedding network, such as BERT [14].\nWe could also use the encoder stage of LLM methods that are specialized on structured, json-like data.\nUltimately, each node is converted to a feature vector which encodes the semantic meaning of the \ufb01elds and relationships (inclusive of edge connections) for that node.\nThen, we agglomeratively combine node features across local sub-graphs using a graph convolutional network (GNN), such as GCNN [15], which results in a single vector encoding features for the many sub-graphs that comprise our global graph.\nWe will use the graph convolutional kernels to aggregate features over a pyramid of graph distances.\nThis is due to the fact that we cannot know a priori how many adjacent nodes of features are informative to the coarse graph search.\nWith these node-level and sub-graph-level feature vectors, we now have an ef\ufb01ciently searchable representation of our graph that can be used to compare nodes across vast distances for semantic similarity.\nThis will be critical when we are searching for nodes and edges that align with user graph interactions, detailed more in section 3.1.3 below.\n3.1.3 Sub-graph Similarity Searching When users manipulate a node, edge, or other element of the graph or schema, we want to identify related elements of the global graph that may also require updates or could inform updates and then make rec- ommendations to the user accordingly.\nIn the last section, we detailed how we can represent the global graph as an ef\ufb01ciently searchable vector space, within which we encode semantic meaning of different sub-graphs.\nWe can exploit these representations to prioritize sub-graphs over which we run LLM-driven, \ufb01ne-grained search for node-level updates.\nIn this manner, we perform slew-to-cue between the coarse- grained sub-graph similarity search and the \ufb01ne-grained LLM node update recommend.\nWe will take the sub-graph embeddings of user-edited nodes and search for similar sub-graphs within the vector database.\nThis search often uses a simple distance measure, such as euclidean or cosine distance, between vectors.\nThe distance in this vector space relates directly to the semantic overlap of two sub- graphs.\nThere is a design tradeoff related to the size of sub-graph that we encode for this vector search.\nChoosing smaller graph sizes will increase the speci\ufb01city of our result and likely yield better matches, at the cost of increased compute in terms of vectorization and search time.\nOn the other hand, encoding larger sub-graphs results in less embedding compute costs and lookup time, while degrading the speci\ufb01city of each vector.\nThis is due to the embedding vector having to encode in feature space a much larger amount of data for larger sub-graphs.\nWe will explore this tradeoff as part of our investigation.\nUse or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to
