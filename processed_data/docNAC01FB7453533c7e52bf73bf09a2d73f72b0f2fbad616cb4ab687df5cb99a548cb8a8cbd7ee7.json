Precision Optical Intra-Cellular Near-field Technology\u201d.\nNanopoint\u2019s technology, funded by NSF via two Phase Is and a Phase II, enables non-destructive intracellular imaging at ultra-high nanoscale resolutions, to create new ways to image and study the dynamic processes within a live cell.\nIn November of 2005, Nanopoint closed Series A round of financing led by Advantage Capital, with Global Venture Capital, Sulphur Creek Ventures, and several angels.\nIn 2007, Nanopoint closed Series B round, and to date has raised more than $20M in private investment.\nIn March 2013, Ibis Networks, now called WattIQ, became Oceanit\u2019s latest spin-out.\nWattIQ is an energy service and data analytics company focused on outlet plug load energy management, providing energy savings for large commercial organizations.\nThe company has raised $30M to date and is poised for growth in key vertical markets including the military, hospitality, and education.\nWattIQ is based on WISPER (Wireless Intelligent Sensor Platform for Emergency Responders) technology developed under a Department of Homeland Security SBIR Phase II.\nIn February 2022, Oceanit's ASSURE-100 Rapid COVID-19 Test received point-of-care emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S.\nFood & Drug Administration and in December 2022 received an over-the-counter EUA for use by consumers at home.\nASSURE-100 is currently ramping up production with partners for increased sales -
