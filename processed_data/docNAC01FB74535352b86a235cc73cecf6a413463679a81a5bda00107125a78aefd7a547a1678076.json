        "9": "Gov.\nProposal # F244-0001-0082 Topic # AF244-0001 However, the freedoms allowed in KGs are not without challenges.\nKGs have been traditionally made by experts, who take considerable amounts of time defining ontologies and schemas that fit available data before placing those data into node and edge relationships.\nThe quality of these expert-defined KGs is very high, but their uses can become brittle (e.g., unwieldly to new data sources or difficult to update).\nThis raises significant challenges in an operational setting in which information can change or require updates on a daily to weekly basis.\nSimple things such as text document formatting or user-supplied information further complicate KG construction.\nWith downstream reasoning and analysis tasks relying on the information stored in the KG, this brittleness can lead to mission failure at worst and significant wasting of human effort at best.\nTo alleviate this pain point, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-based tools have been applied to significantly speed up KG construction processes.\nIn some instances, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted to take over the construction process entirely for text-based sources (Microsoft, 2023).\nOther analysis pipelines and solution spaces may use AI/ML methods to enrich their KG, such as timeseries-based deep learning for pattern of life analysis or computer visions/image summarization-based models.\nIn both cases, the model(s) used to produce the KG are no longer created by humans, but by machines at scale.\nLLM and foundation models' abilities grow daily; however, they remain black boxes with limited control from a user on guiding their output when used in tool pipelines.\nThey lack specificity into current challenges, producing limited insight into the global picture the AF faces.\nThis raises the potential for the previously high-quality construction to be replaced by processes that introduce bias, errors, or conflicting information.\nUltimately, using black box AI/ML approaches (e.g., models with hidden subprocesses) eases the burden of scale and efficiency but adds risks in the newly captured knowledge.\nThe challenges facing automated KG construction via machine-based tools fall into two broad areas: (1) improving the initial extraction done by the AI/ML model, and (2) extending and updating that extracted knowledge as the battlefield evolves.\nFor example, in LLM-based extraction from text to graph, when applied to unstructured text (e.g., publicly available intelligence [PAI] or foreign news articles) concepts such as people, places, or things are extracted and related to each other.\nBecause there is no traditional ground truth (prior known perfect graph) to fit these data, such extractions often require some form of manual check to ensure that the knowledge being consumed is acceptable.\nThis is further compounded if different analysts are performing the verification, given that some choices of concept or relationship will be subjective and do not inherently need to agree.\nThus, KGs may be useful as a tool for analyses of alternatives (e.g., differences in knowledge or gaps in individual knowledge) given appropriate consideration and construction of concepts.\nBeyond the initial extraction, KG construction suffers when deeper reasoning may be needed.\nThe operational space itself is not static, meaning that the data sources may present an ever-changing landscape (e.g., adversaries launch new satellite assets requiring additional nodes to a space domain awareness [SDA] KG).\nAdditionally, unseen patterns may exist in the data such as hotspots of activity that define adversary troop movements over time.\nSuch patterns may appear over time, or be detectable given AI/ML methods, but would remain elusive in a static graph.\nFinally, it may be the case that patterns and data are sourced at a given time but when combined with temporal changes (e.g., a month from now new tactics are seen), the current KG may not be constructed in a manner to harness these changes.\nThis results in an evolving schema or ontology that has cascading effects for downstream analysis.\nAll these challenges bring a complex challenge to AF analysts, personnel, and mission planners: how do we best adapt to these dynamic situations while maintaining the benefits of KGs?\nWe require a flexible, interpretable, and dynamic means of updating our knowledge bases to support AF operations (benefits of dynamic KGs [DKGs] shown in Table 1).\nHow do we best adapt to dynamic situations while maintaining the benefits of knowledge graphs (KGs)?\nWe require a flexible, interpretable, and dynamic means of updating our knowledge bases to support AF operations.\nShepherd will refine and enhance previously extracted and constructed KGs, with strong focus on facilitating user interaction to update stored knowledge while managing shifting sources, schema, and user- defined updates.\nShepherd P-9996-657 Page 2 \u00a9 2024 Aptima, Inc.\nUse or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the first page of this volume.",

        "20": "Gov.\nProposal # F244-0001-0082 Topic # AF244-0001 Using LLMs for KG extraction The sensory data that AFRL analysts have access and need to use to make decisions are often scattered across multiple databases, event logs, and/or free text documents.\nCombining this information is essential for day-to- day operations, yet the concepts, data modalities, and even levels of abstraction often differ across diverse inputs.\nKnowledge graphs (KGs) can be used for structuring and organizing this information to allow common knowledge alignment and access, including combining previously collected disparate data sources, merging structured and unstructured knowledge, summarizing relationships between entities efficiently, creating insights from structured data, and visualizing the relationships and flow of the information across multiple sources.\nWe expect that some of the KGs have already been extracted, e.g., from \u201chard\u201d sensor data.\nIn other situations, KGs can be generated from unstructured inputs such as text documents, or from the event data stream, with supporting ontologies.\nTo create and modify KGs, we will use pretrained LLM models, mimicking both the initial KG creation and user-tool-KG interaction workflow.\nTraditionally, KGs are built using a specific ontology and schema where the ontology describes what the KGs must represent within the domain, whereas the schema specifies how data should be organized.\nSpecifically, ontologies define the set of concepts (classes), their properties, relationships, and constraints for the domain, whereas the schema uses this information to specify the structure for the KG \u2013 including types of nodes, edges, their attributes and labels that the KGs must contain.\nKGs represent knowledge as a network of node entities\u2014 which can correspond to objects, places, events, personas, groups, or concepts\u2014and the relationships between these entities, and they allow extraction of data across multiple unstructured and structured sources as long as they are tied to the same entity or relationship.\nKGs offer computers and human users a mechanism with which to comprehend, reason, and process information in a logical, consistent, and repeatable manner.\nHowever, traditional generation of KGs relied heavily on design and maintenance of ontologies, which demanded substantial manual efforts.\nMultiple recent research works and developed applications show the abilities of LLMs to perform information extraction (IE) and generate KGs as general structured knowledge (entities, events, their relations and properties) from input text sources (Xu et al., 2023) without formal specification of the ontologies, relying on the LLMs\u2019 understanding of broad range of concepts and language semantics.\nLLMs\u2014such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Meta\u2019s LLaMA, or Google\u2019s GEMINI\u2014 not only excel in performing independent IE tasks such as named entity recognition (NER; Yuan et al., 2022), relation extraction (RE; Wan et al., 2023) and event extraction (EE; Wang et al., 2023), they also have the ability to combine these to output aggregated structured knowledge by capturing inter-task dependencies with instructive prompts.\nThe ability of LLMs to perform information extraction, as opposed to language generation, is enabled through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\nMoreover, LLMs can automatically discover types of objects, taxonomy (type hierarchy), and non-taxonomy relations between types, all critical for ontology learning (OL) tasks (Babaei Giglou et al., 2023) using fine-tuned models and advanced prompt engineering.\nWhen performing OL tasks, LLMs use their language understanding skills to derive the concepts that are maximally simple yet sufficiently descriptive to explain the domain of interest.\nEmpowered with RAG style workflow, LLMs can be used to generate KGs for specific sets of input documents.\nIn this task, we will employ LLMs to generate common KGs for both unstructured (text) documents and structured (events with features) records.\nTo do so, we will modify the RAG workflow to retrieve the relational mapping between structured event records and their fields and the linguistic descriptions specifying their meaning.\nExtraction workflows LLMs can be used to generate the structured data from unstructured (text) or structured (events) inputs.\nWhen dealing with structured data, reorganizing the inputs can involve clustering records or variables with common tags or similar properties.\nThis clustering can be performed by using the graph operations discussed in Task 3, below.\nWhen using unstructured text records, four high-level strategies are used to obtain structured outputs, as follows: \uf0a7 Prompting: In this technique, the prompt for the LLM model is created, asking it to return output in the desired format (JSON, XML).\nAlthough there is no guarantee that prompting will obtain the right output, it works with all LLM models and has been in wide use by the research and engineering communities.\nShepherd P-9996-657 Page 13 \u00a9 2024 Aptima, Inc.\nUse or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the first page of this volume.",

(2) it is domain-specific, though this fact does not preclude its use in domains other than that of the MDA; (3) it efficiently bridges both ontologies and databases; and (4) it uses causal reasoning to infer user intent and meaning as well as the root causes of results returned from database queries.\nWhen completed, QUARTERMASTER will empower MDA analysts at all expertise levels to query their datasets naturally and thereby facilitate faster, more complete analyses of BMDS simulations while accelerating the process and completeness of analysis.\nWith QUARTERMASTER, analysts will not have to spend as much time constructing database queries; they will be able to cover more of the domain and focus on more in-depth analyses.\nReFocus: Red Force Custody (TO 15) (Contract 47QFLA24F0083, Air Force Research Laboratory [AFRL] via General Services Administration, Philip Morrone, 315-330-2237, philip.morrone@gsa.gov, 5/20/2024- 5/19/2025).\nJoint Force Planners, Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance Analysts and Command & Control Operators (collectively, Indications & Warning [I&W] analysts) require near real-time situational awareness of adversary assets, actions, and intentions in order to deter, disrupt, and engage enemy operations at scale in contested and degraded environments.\nThe process of monitoring adversary behaviors and predicting future behaviors is technically challenging and cognitively complex, requiring access to a variety of disparate data and tools to fuse and analyze to generate meaningful outcomes.\nHowever, effectively applying artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies to this challenge requires an understanding of the cognitive workflows of I&W analysts.\nFurthermore, the complexity and scale of future warfare is anticipated to exceed human cognitive capabilities, which will also require advanced technologies such as AI/ML to augment I&W analysts.\nThe ReFocus program will address these challenges by leveraging advances in automation and AI/ML to develop and curate target and behavior models from the abstract to \u201csub-object\u201d levels using non- traditional intelligence data fusion, including cyber, cyber-physical, and OSINT.\nUnder this effort, Aptima is creating and analyzing workflow models to identify aspects of work such as technical tasks, data flows, tool usage, and the mission-relevant competencies required for successful performance.\nDetailed information about the I&W workflow will then be used to characterize I&W tasks to develop applications that offer automation and AI/ML.\nWhen complete, the ReFocus program will provide an accelerated I&W process in which analysts can leverage AI/ML to more efficiently process data and more effectively predict adversary behaviors.\nShepherd P-9996-657 Page 25 \u00a9 2024 Aptima, Inc.",

evaluating applications of cutting-edge technologies in the military, national security, aviation, and healthcare communities.\nThe collective expertise of our staff has been applied in multiple engineering domains including artificial intelligence and human-machine teaming, military C3, complex information display, decision support, emergency preparedness, organizational design, technology evaluation, performance measurement, and cognitive skills and cultural training.\nThis breadth provides Aptima with a wide- ranging base of market knowledge to identify transition opportunities.\nCommercialization Track Record Aptima's transition score is consistently among the highest: our ability to combine technical excellence with a focused marketing approach has resulted in an impressive track record of transitioning SBIR projects to Phase III work and commercial solutions.\nMore specifically, we have successfully obtained additional investment for more than 40% of our SBIR Phase II contracts, representing additional investment that is equal to 80% of our total Phase II awards.\nTo further our ongoing commitment to commercialization, in 2014 Aptima launched Aptima Ventures, LLC, with the sole mission to identify and commercialize high-potential, early-stage technologies originating from Aptima, Inc.\nunder the SBIR program and other government funding.\nTo date, Aptima Ventures has launched four companies that have commercialized Aptima technologies, the most recent of which is the 2020 spinoff of Sentinel Occupational Safety to market Aptima\u2019s SafeGuardTM Safety as a Service (SaaS) technology for worker monitoring in hazardous and confined space areas.\nSafeGuard evolved as a direct result of Aptima\u2019s SBIR technology development efforts.\nSentinel recently completed its $2.125M seed fund-raising round, furthering the roughly $8M of Government-funded R&D it conducted on its way to market.\nPrivileged and
