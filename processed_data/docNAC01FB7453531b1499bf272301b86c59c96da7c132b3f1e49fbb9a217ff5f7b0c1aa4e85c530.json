        "5": "immediate changes to the graph as new data becomes available and/or as a user interacts with the graph.\nOur objective is to extend the platform to include this capability.\nGraph Studio loads knowledge graphs in memory for dynamic access, so it provides the foundation necessary to allow users to make changes to loaded knowledge graphs; that is, at run time.\nBased upon this foundation, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) will aim to close the gap in reaching the dynamic knowledge graph capabilities in support of situational awareness, pattern of life analysis, threat detection, and targeting operations in a real-time capacity.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) and NLP techniques, such as named entity recognition and relationship extraction, can lay the foundation to support a machine\u2019s understanding of the underlying graph based upon its unstructured data.\nIn turn, ML algorithms can be leveraged to predict missing links between entities in the graph, identify and merge duplicate entities, and automatically detect and adapt the graph schema to accommodate new entity types and relationships.\nML can also be used to generate interactive visualizations of the knowledge graph, highlighting important relationships or insights about the graph itself.\nThe development of an integrated recommendation system will allow for those highlights to be based upon user changes and/or personalized for individual users based upon interests and past behavior.\nPractically, a user represents another client to the platform, and we will implement change management, provenance tracking, and apply access control policies to users in different roles in these cases.\nAnticipated Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development: The anticipated benefits include highly curated knowledge graphs, more effective situational awareness, and improved accuracy of outputs from downstream applications.\nCommercial applications of interactive knowledge graphs include improved analysis, decision making and trust.\nThe ability to dynamically curate knowledge graphs adds a new dimension to the current platform and increases our overall capabilities offerings.\nFor example, dynamically changing knowledge graphs allows our customers to more easily optimize their generative AI applications that rely on high quality knowledge graphs.\nIn addition, applications of a dynamic knowledge graph extend to include real-time decision-making, IoT data analysis, event tracking, anomaly detection, and social network analysis.\nAttention: Disclaimer: For any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, this data except proposal cover sheets shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used or disclosed in whole or in part, provided that if a contract is awarded to this proposer as a result of or in connection with the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the funding agreement.\nThis restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in the data if it is obtained from another source without restriction.\nThis restriction does not apply to routine handling of proposals for administrative purposes by Government support contractors.\nThe data subject to this restriction is contained on the pages of the proposal listed on the line below.\nAddition: Enter the page numbers separated by a space of the pages in the proposal that are considered proprietary: List a maximum of 8 Key Words or phrases, separated by commas, that describe the Project:",
